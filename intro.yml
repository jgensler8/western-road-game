- you wake up
- |-
  what's this?
  oh, a piece of paper
- here, take this money
- |-
  i have a present
  waiting for you
- its at the end of the path
- the end of the path?
- but, i don't even know
  where i am...
- ...
- if i don't know why
  i'm here...
- then i don't really
  have much of a choice
- |-
  you open the door and
  embark on the journey
